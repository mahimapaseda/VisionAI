## Overview
VisionAI is an open-source AI camera application delivering **real-time object detection**, **face recognition**, **motion tracking**, and **privacy protection**. Utilizing the ultra-fast YOLOv8 Nano model, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, VisionAI runs on Python 3.8+ and requires minimal setup.

> **SEO Keywords:** real-time object detection, YOLOv8 Python, AI camera, face recognition, motion tracking, intelligent surveillance

---

## Key Features
- **YOLOv8-Powered Object Detection** â€“ Accurate, low-latency detection of 80+ classes.
- **Advanced Face Recognition** â€“ Detect faces with privacy blurring mode to protect identity.
- **Motion Tracking** â€“ Background subtraction to highlight movement areas.
- **Gesture & Pose Estimation** â€“ Optional MediaPipe support for hand and body pose detection.
- **Voice Control** â€“ Speech recognition and text-to-speech commands (optional).
- **Smart Recording** â€“ Timestamped video recording (AVI) and high-quality screenshots (JPG).
- **Detection Logging & Export** â€“ Maintain a log of events and export to CSV.
- **Dual GUI Modes**: 
  - âš¡ **Optimized Mode** for streamlined controls and performance.  
  - ðŸš€ **Pro Mode** for tabbed analytics, settings, and export tools.

## Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VisionAI.git
cd VisionAI

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize directories & download model
python setup.py

# Launch VisionAI
python vision_ai.py
```

---

## Installation & Setup
1. **Prerequisites**:  
   - Python 3.8 or higher  
   - Webcam or USB camera  
   - Internet connection for first-run downloads

2. **Install packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run setup script**:
   ```bash
   python setup.py
   ```
   This creates required folders (`profiles`, `detected_faces`, `models`) and downloads `yolov8n.pt`.

---

## Usage Examples
### Launch GUI
```bash
python vision_ai.py
```

- Switch between **Optimized** and **Pro** modes via the top-right selector.
- Toggle detection options: objects, faces, motion, privacy blur, gestures.
- Start/stop the camera feed, record video, and capture screenshots.

### Command-Line Cleanup Utility
```bash
python cleanup.py
```
Removes build artifacts, caches, and old media files to free storage.

---

## Configuration
Customize detection and performance parameters in `vision_ai.py` or extract to a separate config file:
```python
# YOLO settings
yolo_confidence = 0.4
yolo_iou = 0.5
max_detections = 50

# Motion detection
motion_area_threshold = 1000

# Frame processing
frame_skip = 2  # process every 2nd frame
```

---

## Packaging & Distribution
- **Standalone EXE** (Windows):
  ```bash
  python build_exe.py
  ```
  Produces `dist/VisionAI.exe` and `dist/Install_VisionAI.bat`.

- **Portable ZIP**:
  ```bash
  python create_portable.py
  ```
  Creates `VisionAI_Portable.zip` containing all necessary files.
